# VPN Research Notes

## 🔐 What is a VPN?
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a secure tunnel between your device and the internet. It encrypts your traffic and masks your IP.

## 🔧 How It Works
- Uses tunneling protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2/IPSec
- Encrypts packets before sending through the VPN server
- Website sees the IP of the VPN, not the user

## ✅ Benefits
- Encrypts traffic on public Wi-Fi
- Bypasses geo-blocking
- Hides IP address and masks location
- Helps avoid ISP tracking

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Slower browsing speeds due to encryption
- Free VPNs may have data limits
- VPN logs (on some providers) can still be stored
- Does not protect from malware or phishing

## 🔁 VPN vs Proxy
- VPN = Full traffic encryption (system-wide)
- Proxy = Traffic routing (usually browser only, no encryption)
