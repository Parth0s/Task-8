# Task-8# Task 8: VPN Setup and Privacy Exploration

## 🎯 Objective
To understand how VPNs protect user privacy and secure internet connections through hands-on setup and testing of a free VPN client.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- ProtonVPN Free Tier
- whatismyipaddress.com (to verify IP change)

## 🧪 What I Did
- Signed up for a free ProtonVPN account
- Downloaded and installed the VPN client
- Connected to a server in the Netherlands
- Verified my IP changed using whatismyipaddress.com
- Browsed websites to test encrypted traffic
- Disconnected VPN and compared IP and speed

## 📸 Screenshots
- `vpn_connected.png`: Screenshot of active VPN session
- `vpn_ip_check.png`: Screenshot showing changed IP

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- VPNs encrypt all traffic between your device and the VPN server
- They hide your IP from websites, adding a layer of anonymity
- Not all VPNs offer true anonymity or no-logs policy

## 📘 Notes
See `vpn_research_notes.md` for encryption protocols, benefits, and limitations of VPNs.
